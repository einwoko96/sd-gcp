# Senior Design Video Classification Project

Extract features from each frame with a ConvNet and pass the sequence to an MLP.


## Requirements

This code requires you have Keras 2 and TensorFlow 1 or greater installed. Please see the `requirements.txt` file. To ensure you're up to date, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Local Setup & Run

First, download the dataset from UCF into the `data` folder:

`cd data && wget http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101/UCF101.rar`

Then extract it with `unrar e UCF101.rar`.

Next, create folders (still in the data folder) with `mkdir train && mkdir test && mkdir sequences && mkdir checkpoints`.

Now you can run the scripts in the data folder to move the videos to the appropriate place, extract their frames and make the CSV file the rest of the code references. You need to run these in order. Example:

`python 1_move_files.py`

`python 2_extract_files.py`

Extract features from frames

`python extract_features.py`

Train the model

`python train.py`
